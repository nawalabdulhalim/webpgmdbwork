Github is a coding platform that allows people to colllaborate together on the same code. I can grant people permission to my code so they can contribute. At the moment my github account will be used to experiment as well as assignments.
A repository keeps track of all the changes that occur to my code.
I cloned my repository by opening github desktop. After logging in, it opened a prompt asking me if I would like to clone the repository I made already made, onto my machine. I clicked okay. I can find the repository by going on finder and clicking on documents. It shows the github folder which will open up to my repository folder.
