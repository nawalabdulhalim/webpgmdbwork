    <h1>My name is Nawal Abdulhalim</h1>
     <p> I am Palestinian and I take so much pride in my heritage because of the political turmoil that surrounds my identity and my existence. Other than my culture I love to read, when I was a kid I used to think that diving into the meaning behind books and why people wrote such books was a waste of time. As I get older I have an appreciation for it. Reading not only expands our minds but our relationships, the more I read the more empathy I gain and more acceptance to the world around me. It’s also a form of escapism, it’s so exhilarating to read about high risk high reward adventures, without having to leave the comfort of my bed. </p>
